# Interactive Management App
ORCA Project 2023-2024

The objective of this project is to design and build an open source browser-based tool for conducting Interpretive Structural Modeling research with participants. It includes a series of questions about pairs of variables (called "factors") and whether or not those factors are related to one another. The software will produce a flow diagram of the relationships between factors as identified by the participant, and provide the researchers with one flow diagram that averages the data across all participants in a particular study. The flow diagram will suggest factors that are likely more effective to address first, and factors that are likely to follow or become easier to address as a result of addressing earlier factors.

## Reference App
We only have the EXE file, it will only work on windows and requires Java Runtime 1.6 but will run on more modern version of Java ([Download Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp))
