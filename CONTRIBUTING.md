## Development norms ##

<section>
TODO: Decide on these things together:

- [ ] Coding languages and versions
- [ ] Development environment: IDE, extensions/plugins, etc
- [ ] Code style and norms
- [ ] How we want to use Git/VCS
- [ ] How to make a significant change to the project
</section>

This document was made with guidance from [Contributing.md](https://contributing.md) and [GitHub Guidelines for Contributors](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors). It is a living document and should reflect the opinions and needs of the current ORCA ISM team.

1. Coding language(s)
    - Version of Python?
2. IDE
    - Everyone uses the same?
    - VSCode, PyCharm
3. Code Style?
    - Linter (Flake8?)
    - Norms
        - NetID for functions?
            - ```[your_netID]_some_function()```
        - Folder/directory tree?
        - Including license?
    - Testing
4. Git
    - Protect main - merging/pull requests?
        - Has a time cost, but results in fewer bugs/issues and keeps everyone familiar with everyone else's work
    - Branches?
        - Feature/Issue branches
        - One branch for each person
        - Push/pull frequency

5. Making changes/refactoring
    - What is OK to change as needed?
    - What should need a 5-minute review before changing?
    - Modifying other's code/issues
        - How to handle with git?
        - Distribution of work items

6. Working together
    - Pair work
    - Getting help

7. Divide and conquer
    - Are you working on what you want to be working on?
    - Are you getting what you want out of this project so far?
