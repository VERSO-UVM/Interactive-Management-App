      <h2>Interpretive Structural Method Explained</h2>
      <p>Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) is a systematic methodology used to analyze and understand complex relationships within a given problem.
         It involves a structured process where participants identify key factors affecting the issue at hand. These factors are then explored to determine how they interact and influence one another.
          ISM then builds a visual representation, effectively identifying the most critical factors and presenting the results in a clearly articulated model. 
          By prioritizing actions based on impact, ISM facilitates a clear path towards resolving complex problems.
