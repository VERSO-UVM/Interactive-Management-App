            <p> This Interactive Managment App is an open source tool for conducting Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) research with participants in order to help a group of people solve a collective problem. 
                This app takes in a list of factors identified by research participants that affect a specific problem. 
                It will then work with participants to figure out the relationships between factors (things that impact their ability to act). 
                An algorithm will then be used to create a diagram that clearly shows how the factors affect each other, and in what order they should be addressed.</p>
