# Contributing to the ISM Project #

This document was made with guidance from [Contributing.md](https://contributing.md) and [GitHub Guidelines for Contributors](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors). It is a living document and should reflect the opinions and needs of the current ORCA ISM team.

1. Coding language(s)
    - Python
2. IDE
    - VSCode, PyCharm
3. Code Style
    - Linter (Flake8?)
    - Norms
        - NetID as a starting comment so we know who created a given function
        - Folder/directory tree for orfganization
        - Including license in the file helps ensure the license remains with the project
    - Testing it helpful, ask someone else to test what you have written
4. Git
    - Protect main - merging/pull requests required
    - Branches
        - Feature/Issue branches
        - One branch for each person
        - Push/pull frequently

5. Making changes/refactoring
    - What is OK to change as needed?
    - What should need a 5-minute review before changing?
    - Modifying other's code/issues
        - How to handle with git?
        - Distribution of work items

6. Working together
    - Working as a pair can often lead to better results
    - Ask for help often, no one is judged for not knowing something

7. Divide and conquer
    - Are you working on what you want to be working on?
    - Are you getting what you want out of this project so far?
